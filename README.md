# comment-toxicity-pythonML

This repository demonstrates a process for building a model to classify toxic comments.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to train a machine learning model to identify different types of toxicity in online comments. This involves data loading, preprocessing, model building using a neural network, training, and evaluation.

## Setup and Dependencies

This project is designed to run in Google Colab. It uses the following libraries:

*   `pandas` for data manipulation
*   `tensorflow` for building and training the neural network
*   `numpy` for numerical operations
*   `matplotlib` for plotting

No additional installation steps should be necessary when running in Colab, as these libraries are typically pre-installed.

## Dataset

The dataset used is `train.csv`, which is assumed to be located in your Google Drive at `/content/drive/MyDrive/train.csv`. This dataset contains comments and labels indicating different categories of toxicity.

## Model Architecture

The model is a sequential Keras model with the following layers:

*   An `Embedding` layer to represent words as dense vectors.
*   A `Bidirectional LSTM` layer to capture sequential information in the text.  
*   Several `Dense` layers with `relu` activation for processing features.
*   A final `Dense` layer with `sigmoid` activation for multi-label classification.

## Usage

1.  **Load the notebook:** Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2.  **Connect to Google Drive:** Ensure your Google Drive is mounted to access the `train.csv` file.
3.  **Run the cells:** Execute the cells sequentially to load data, preprocess it, build and train the model, and evaluate its performance.

The collab notebook includes steps for:

*   Loading the data using pandas.
*   Vectorizing the text data using `TextVectorization`.
*   Preparing the data for TensorFlow using `tf.data.Dataset`.
*   Defining and compiling the sequential model.
*   Training the model.
*   Visualizing the training history.
*   Making predictions on new text.
*   Evaluating the model's performance using Precision, Recall, and Categorical Accuracy.

## Results

The notebook includes a plot of the training history and prints the evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, and Accuracy) on the test set. Note that training for only one epoch might result in lower performance, and training for more epochs would likely improve the metrics.

## Further Improvements

*   Experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters.
*   Explore different text preprocessing techniques.
*   Train the model for more epochs.
*   Implement more advanced evaluation metrics.
*   Handle potential class imbalance in the dataset.
